The challenges have a certain device selected in their platformio.ini file selected.
You can use that, or select another one from the following list, or you can use your own one:

The list of testes devices:
    * Arduino Uno
    * Arduino Mega
    * Arduino Nano
    * ESP32 - NodeMCU
    * ESP8266

But it is advised to use the provided type of microcontroller, because the tests are fine tuned for that.
On the other hand, the challenges could rely on a certain memory size in a microcontroller,
to make the challenge even harder, so please use the provided ones.
