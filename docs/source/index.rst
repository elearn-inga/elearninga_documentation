Welcome to eLearninga's documentation!
======================================

`eLearninga`_ enables you to learn and teach on embedded systems without owning them.

Introduction
------------

What is this about?
    We want to create a platform, where people can learn to program on robots and microcontrollers, and to develop their skills through interesting online challenges. We would like to help people who have no robots, and microcontrollers at home, but want to learn, and be a part of an embedded challenge community. 
How do we want to achieve it?
    We would like to build a community, where people can share their microcontrollers, share their challenge ideas, and evolve together.
How can you join?
    You can join as a teacher or as a student. (it is the best, if you do both :) )
Do you want to use it as a teacher?
    You can share your own devices with the community or certain group of people
    Write embedded challenges
Do you want to use it as a student?
    You can learn embedded programming via challenges on the boards of the community or on your own.
