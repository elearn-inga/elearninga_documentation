Introduction
------------

What is this about?
    We want to create a platform, where people can learn to program on robots and microcontrollers, and to develop their skills through interesting online challenges. We would like to help people who have no robots, and microcontrollers at home, but want to learn, and be a part of an embedded challenge community. 
How do we want to achieve it?
    We would like to build a community, where people can share their microcontrollers, share their challenge ideas, and evolve together.
How can you join?
    You can join to learn or to contribute. (it is the best, if you do both :) )
Do you want to use it to learn?
   You can learn embedded programming via challenges on the boards of the community or on your own.
Do you want to use it to teach?
   You can use the platform to create home assignements for your students using already available devices and challenges.
   You can use the remote devices as demonstration tools for your videos and live streams.
Would you like to contribute?
    You can share your own devices with the community or certain group of people.
    You can write new, exciting embedded challenges.
